# MERN JWT Authentication

## Stack:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node

## Summary:

I created a full stack project which has login,logout, signup functionalities.

## What I learned:

- I learned to how to add JWT to authenticated a user
- How to allow access to certian routes only if the user if authenticated.
- Creating Api with Redux Toolkit
- Building the logic on how the frontend communicates with the backend

## To Run On You Own:

`You must have your own MongoDB URI and .env variables`  
`I have provided a .envDummy, just remove the Dummy and add your values to run the project`

1. Clone the repository
2. On your terminal run `npm i`
3. Then run `npm run dev`
4. Finally the project will be online on `localhost:3000`
